Choria uses the excellent [NATS.io](https://nats.io/) broker by default.  It's very fast, light weight, has a simple configuration and is easy to monitor.  It's configured to only accept connections from nodes with certificates signed by the Puppet CA.

One NATS server has been shown to be able to host over 2000 MCollective nodes comfortably using 300MB RAM.

## Prerequisites

 * Broker nodes must be managed by Puppet and have certs signed by your CA
 * Brokers must run 64bit Linux with _upstart_, _systemd_ or _sysvinit_
 * You need to get the [choria-nats](https://forge.puppet.com/choria/nats) module from the Puppet Forge, if you followed this guide you already have this
 * You need to ensure that port `4222` is reachable from all your Puppet nodes to all NATS servers
 * You need to ensure that in a clustered environment port `4223` is reachable between all the NATS cluster hosts
 * If you wish to use the _collectd_ integration, port `8222` must be reachable from _localhost_

## Single or multiple nodes

The decision to run multiple nodes is about availability and scale.  As mentioned NATS can easily handle large numbers of nodes on a single broker, if this is your first deployment there is no reason right now to think about a cluster of brokers.  As you'll see configuring a cluster is very easy and easily done later.

If you choose to do 1 only keep it simple and install it on your Puppet Master.  This removes the need to configure DNS (the next section) and gets you going ready to explore the possibilities quickly, you can easily later add servers.

## Federated or Single Cluster

As NATS only support a Full Mesh architecture it is not a a good idea to run one single large globally distributed NATS cluster.  Choria supports Federating many small MCollectives together to facilitate geographic deployments. Federation would also make sense if you are in one location but have many thousands of nodes.

As before if you're getting started you should focus on deploying a single location and familiarising yourself with Choria and MCollective.  Should you then choose to go ahead review the [Federation](../../federation) section of the documentation.  Deploying Federation is easy but you need to understand a bit more architecturally and it has additional monitoring utilities which are best covered seperately.

## Single node

If you just want to run a single NATS server I suggest putting this on the same machine as your Puppet Server which would by default be resolvable as _puppet_.  This means you do not need to configure anything in Choria as that's the default it assumes.

```puppet
node "puppet.example.net" {
  class{"nats": }
}
```

## Cluster of NATS Brokers

You can create a cluster of brokers, pick 3 or 5 machines and include the module on them all listing the entire cluster certnames. If you do a cluster you must configure Choria via [DNS or manually](../dns/).

```puppet
node "nats1.example.net" {
  class{"nats":
    routes_password => "Vrph54FBcIvdM"
    servers => [
      "nats1.example.net",
      "nats2.example.net",
      "nats3.example.net",
      "nats4.example.net",
      "nats5.example.net"
    ],
  }
}
```

## Collectd Integration

If you use the _puppet-collectd_ module you can optionally integrate with that:

```puppet
node "puppet.example.net" {
  class{"nats":
    manage_collectd => true
  }
}
```

## Large deploys

A note about large deploys such as when you have 1 000s of nodes connected to a single NATS server.  NATS has no problem handling this but your kernel might consider the large amount of reconnects after you restarted NATS as a DDoS attempt and throttle the SYN packets.

You can use the <a href="https://forge.puppet.com/thias/sysctl">thias/sysctl</a> module to manage this

You can overcome this by adjusting these sysctl settings:

```yaml
net.core.somaxconn: 4092
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog: 8192
```
