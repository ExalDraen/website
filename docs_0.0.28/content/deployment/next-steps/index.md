At this point you should have a working MCollective set up with your user able to do any command of the plugins we deployed.

## Confirming it is working

You can inspect the resulting configuration on your CLI:

```bash
$ mco choria show_config
Active Choria configuration:

The active configuration used in Choria comes from using Puppet AIO defaults, querying SRV
records and reading configuration files.  The below information shows the completely resolved
configuration that will be used when running MCollective commands

MCollective selated:

 MCollective Version: 2.9.1
  Client Config File: /etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/client.cfg
  Active Config File: /etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/client.cfg
   Plugin Config Dir: /etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/plugin.d
   Using SRV Records: true
          SRV Domain: dev.example.net
  Middleware Servers: nats1.example.net:4222, nats2.example.net:4222, nats3.example.net:4222

Puppet related:

       Puppet Server: puppet1.example.net:8140
     PuppetCA Server: puppet1.example.net:8140
     PuppetDB Server: puppet1.example.net:8140
      Facter Command: /opt/puppetlabs/bin/facter
       Facter Domain: example.net

SSL setup:

     Valid SSL Setup: yes
            Certname: rip.mcollective
       SSL Directory: /home/rip/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl (found)
  Client Public Cert: /home/rip/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/rip.mcollective.pem (found)
  Client Private Key: /home/rip/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/rip.mcollective.pem (found)
             CA Path: /home/rip/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem (found)
            CSR Path: /home/rip/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/certificate_requests/rip.mcollective.pem (found)

Active Choria configuration settings as found in configuration files:

              choria.srv_domain: dev.example.net

```

Here you'll see all results from your SRV records, config files, defaults etc all resolved.  You can run
this as root or a normal user and see it pick the right files etc

You can confirm you have some nodes connected to your collective - and get some information
about which middleware server they used in the case of clusters:

```bash
$ mco rpc choria_util info

Discovering hosts using the choria method .... 3

 * [ ============================================================> ] 1 / 1



Summary of Client Flavour:

   nats-pure = 3

Summary of Client Version:

   0.2.0 = 3

Summary of Connected Broker:

   puppet1.example.net:4222 = 1
   puppet2.example.net:4222 = 2

Summary of SRV Domain:

   example.net = 2

Summary of SRV Used:

   true = 1


Finished processing 3 / 3 hosts in 228.40 ms
```

Here we observe 3 nodes with 1 connected to *puppet1.example.net:4222* and 2 connected to *puppet2.example.net:4222*.  Add *--display allways* for much more details.

From the shell you set up the user in lets check the version of _puppet-agent_ installed on your nodes:

```bash
$ mco package status puppet-agent

 * [ ============================================================> ] 15 / 15

                 dev1.example.net: puppet-agent-1.8.0-1.el7.x86_64
                 dev2.example.net: puppet-agent-1.8.0-1.el7.x86_64
                 dev3.example.net: puppet-agent-1.8.0-1.el7.x86_64

Summary of Arch:

   x86_64 = 3

Summary of Ensure:

   1.8.0-1.el7 = 3


Finished processing 3 / 3 hosts in 71.63 ms
```

MCollective knows a lot about your nodes such as all their Facts and Puppet Classes deployed to them, you
can view what it knows about a certain node, this should include your classes, facts and agents deployed:

{{% notice tip %}}
MCollective identities match the certificate names from Puppet
{{% /notice %}}

```bash
$ mco inventory dev1.example.net

      ...
```

You can get a quick report of values for some fact (add -v for node names):

```bash
$ mco facts aio_agent_version
Report for fact: aio_agent_version

We can check that the Puppet service is up:

```bash
$ mco service status puppet

 * [ ============================================================> ] 3 / 3

   dev3.example.net: running
   dev2.example.net: running
   dev1.example.net: running

Summary of Service Status:

   running = 3


Finished processing 3 / 3 hosts in 98.98 ms
```

And when last Puppet ran on these nodes:

```bash
$ mco puppet status

 * [ ============================================================> ] 3 / 3

   dev1.example.net: Currently idling; last completed run 6 minutes 20 seconds ago
   dev2.example.net: Currently idling; last completed run 10 minutes 04 seconds ago
   dev3.example.net: Currently idling; last completed run 25 seconds ago

Summary of Applying:

   false = 3

Summary of Daemon Running:

   running = 3

Summary of Enabled:

   enabled = 3

Summary of Idling:

   true = 3

Summary of Status:

   idling = 3


Finished processing 3 / 3 hosts in 28.27 ms
```

## Further reading

There is much to learn about MCollective, at this point if all worked you'll have a setup
that is secured by using TLS on every middleware connection and every user securely identified
and authorized via the Puppet SSL certificates with auditing and logging.

Choria has a few optional features related to integration with PuppetDB and Puppet Server,
please see the [optional configuration](http://choria.io/docs/configuration/) section. You should
also read about [Choria Playbooks](http://choria.io/docs/playbooks).

The official documentation is a good resource for usage details:

  * I strongly suggest you read about [using the mcollective CLI](https://docs.puppet.com/mcollective/reference/basic/basic_cli_usage.html)
  * Read about [filtering which hosts to act on](https://docs.puppet.com/mcollective/reference/ui/filters.html)
  * Read about [managing Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-puppet-agent#usage) though note the setup steps are already completed
  * Read about [managing packages](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-package-agent#readme) though note the setup steps are already completed
  * Read about [managing services](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-service-agent#readme) though note the setup steps are already completed
  * Read about [managing files](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-filemgr-agent#readme) and this setup too is already completed

These plugins that manage Service, Package, Puppet and Files are just plugins and they make the
main user facing feature set of Mcollective.  You can write your own plugins, deploy them and interact with
them.  There is an [official guide about this](https://docs.puppet.com/mcollective/simplerpc/agents.html).

If you do write your own plugins Choria helps you [package your plugins](../../configuration/plugins/) as Puppet modules like the ones we
just installed, sharable on the Forge.

## Getting in touch

I am on the Puppet IRC as _Volcane_ and on slack as _ripienaar_, we also have a _#mcollective_ channel on Freenode.

If you wish to file a ticket about anything here or improve something the 2 GitHub project are [choria-io/mcollective-choria](https://github.com/choria-io/mcollective-choria)
