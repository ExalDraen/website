# Deployment

Choria is designed to install MCollective very easily, the installation is completely driven by Puppet and Hiera and have very few requirements.

After following this guide you will have a fully functional MCollective set up with TLS encryption, full Authentication, Authorization and Auditing and several useful plugins configured.

Even if you have to do things like open up Firewall ports it's anticipated that deploying MCollective using Choria should not take longer than 1 hour.
