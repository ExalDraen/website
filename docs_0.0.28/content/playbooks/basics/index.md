Lets consider a basic Playbook.  This will:

  * Pick nodes based on a *cluster* fact via PuppetDB based discovery
  * Test if they are reachable over mcollective
  * Verify their MCollective agent versions match our required versions as SemVer ranges
  * Disable Puppet on all the nodes
  * Wait for puppet to go idle
  * Stop the *httpd* service on all nodes with 2 retries
  * Run a app upgrade step on a custom agent to a specific version, 5 at a time, with retries, summarize the results
  * Start the *httpd* service on all nodes with 2 retries
  * Enable Puppet
  * Trigger a splay Puppet run
  * On success notify slack and a custom webhook
  * On failure notify slack and a custom webhook

Its quite limited for now but shows the basics

You can run this playbook through the CLI, but lets look at help first, you can see our inputs are provided via *--cluster* and *--target_version*:

```bash
$ mco playbook playbook.yaml --help

Choria Playbook Runner

Usage:   mco playbook [OPTIONS] <ACTION> <PLAYBOOK>

  The ACTION can be one of the following:

    show      - preview the playbook
    run       - run the playbook as your local user

  The PLAYBOOK is a YAML file describing the tasks

  Passing --help as well as a PLAYBOOK argument will show
  flags and help related to the specific playbook.

  Any inputs to the playbook should be given on the CLI.

Application Options
        --cluster CLUSTER            Cluster to deploy (String)
        --target_version VERSION     Version of Acme to deploy (String)
        --loglevel LEVEL             Override the loglevel set in the playbook (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
    -c, --config FILE                Load configuration from file rather than default
    -v, --verbose                    Be verbose
    -h, --help                       Display this screen

The Marionette Collective 2.9.1
```

And you can run the playbook using `mco playbook run playbook.yaml --cluster alpha --target_version 0.10`
