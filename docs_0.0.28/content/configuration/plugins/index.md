MCollective have many plugins, the most common ones are _agents_.

In the past packaging was done via RPM or Deb packages, this was extremely limited requiring extra work to make configuration modules and of course only worked on those operating systems.

## Packaging

Choria includes a packager that turns a common MCollective plugin into a Puppet Module like the [Puppet Agent one](https://forge.puppet.com/choria/mcollective_agent_puppet).

You can package your own modules in this manner:

```bash
$ cd youragent
$ mco plugin package --format aiomodulepackage --vendor yourco
```

This will produce a Puppet module that you can install using Choria by adding it to the list of plugins to manage:

```yaml
mcollective::plugin_classes:
  - mcollective_agent_youragent
```

## Plugin Configuration
Many MCollective plugins have extensive configuration, some times Server and Client side.

The _choria-mcollective_ module lets you configure any setting in any plugin via _Hiera_ data, here's an example of configuring the Puppet one:

```yaml
mcollective_agent_puppet::config:
  "splay": false
  "signal_daemon": true
```

This creates files in _/etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/plugin.d_ with the per plugin settings.  This will only work on plugins distributed using the method shown above.
